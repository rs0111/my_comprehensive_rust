# Day 1: Afternoon

## Memo

### Tuples and Arrays

- Tuples and Arrays are the `compound` types
- All elements of an array have the same type
- Tuples can accommodate different types
- Both types have a size fixed at compile time

### Array Iteration

- The `for` statement supports iterating arrays (but not tuples)

### Pattern Matching

- The `match` keyword lets you match a value against one or more *patterns*
- The comparisons are done from top to bottom and the first match wins
